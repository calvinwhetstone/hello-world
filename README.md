# hello-world
Trying out Github!

My name is Calvin Whetstone. I am fairly new to devlopment and design. I started working in doftware devlopment as a QA about 4 months ago, and in the process I have learned alot about the field and what I would like to move toward. I have found I don't have much of a desire for back-end development, but I have enjoyed more of the front-end and design elements of web stuff. I am hoping to move toward a job in web design and this is a step I am taking to begin to learn more of what I need to know!
